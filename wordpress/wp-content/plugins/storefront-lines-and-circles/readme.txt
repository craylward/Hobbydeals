Adds awesome lines and circles animation on the front page of your website!

== Description ==
=== What does it do ===
Adds awesome lines and circles animation on your storefront installation with 5 circles connected to each other by lines, each circle shows an image in it with  a heading and some description below it. Ideal for showing of key features of your organization, your product ( like a theme or a software ).

=== Structure ===
First four circles are customizable with custom image, heading and description. The last circle shows a scroll down button which scrolls the page down to show the content below the animation.
